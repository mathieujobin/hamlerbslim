# HAML vs ERB vs SLIM

It has been going around, that HAML is performing badly when compared to other template languages in the Ruby/Rails world. For [Cologne.rb](http://www.colognerb.de), [Lucas](https://github.com/moonglum) and I were preparing a talk about HAMLvsERB. So I wanted to investigate the differences in render time and possible requests per second.

Here are my results :smile:

This is a simple Rails App that uses one of the [Twitter Bootstrap Samples](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/fluid.html) with just a little bit of Ruby Code to demonstrate the differences in parsing speeds between the three template languages

If you find anything that doesn't add up or you want to investigate any of the open questions, please discuss this on [Hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4663724) or send me an Issue or Pull Request



## How to setup?
```
git clone https://github.com/klaustopher/hamlerbslim.git
cd hamlerbslim
bundle
SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(date '+%s') rails server -e production >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```

## With hamlit
```
export USE_HAMLIT=true
bundle
SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(date '+%s') rails server -e production >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```

### Use puma
```
export USE_PUMA=true
bundle
SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(date '+%s') rails server -e production >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```

To get the numbers, use [AB (Apache Benchmark)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html)

```
ab -n 1000 -c 1 http://localhost:3000/erb
ab -n 1000 -c 1 http://localhost:3000/haml
ab -n 1000 -c 1 http://localhost:3000/slim
```

## What I want to test in the future
* Does the amount of partials make a difference (because the parser is invoked multiple times)? ==> Do patterns like [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/)/[SMURF](https://github.com/railslove/smurfville#smurf-philosophy) have a huge negative impact on render time?
* Do other servers (like Puma, Unicorn, Thin, etc) make a difference?
* Is it reproducable on other stacks like Sinatra?

## Results I got

Here are my results, I ran them a few times, with and without restarting the server in between, it didn't really make a difference
